# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Analysis using K-Means

## 📘 Project Overview
This project performs **Customer Segmentation Analysis** for an e-commerce company.  
The goal is to group customers into meaningful clusters based on their purchasing behavior using **K-Means Clustering**.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** ifood_df.csv  
- **Description:** Contains customer information such as demographics, spending behavior, and campaign responses.

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded dataset using Pandas
- Checked shape, null values, and data types

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Normalized numerical columns

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution plots for key spending categories

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Selected numerical features for clustering
- Scaled data using **StandardScaler**

### 5. Clustering
- Determined optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group customers

### 6. Visualization
- Visualized customer segments using **PCA (2D plot)**

### 7. Insights
- Interpreted each cluster based on spending and demographic behavior
